## 1. Authentication Flow
If you are not authenticated, attempting to add products will trigger a login redirect.

After authentication, you can add products to the cart.

## 2. Barcode Scanner
Use the web-based barcode scanner to scan product barcodes.

Scanned products are automatically added to the cart.

## üéñÔ∏è Design Choices
### Grid Layout for Product Display:

Optimized the modal layout with a grid to display the image, name, and price on one side, and the description and reviews on the other side.

### Responsive UI:

Used Tailwind CSS to ensure the app is fully responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Smooth Transitions:

Added hover and transition effects for a better user experience.

## üöß Challenges Faced
### State Management:

Using useContext for state management simplified handling cart items globally without requiring Redux.

### Barcode Scanner Integration:

Ensuring the scanner works seamlessly across different devices and browsers required testing and fine-tuning.
